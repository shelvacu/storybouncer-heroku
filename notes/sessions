 -id
 -key: randomly-generated alphanumeric string 64 characters long (str)
 -usetime: Time the session was last used
 -userid: id of user whom the session belongs to (int)
 -useragent: Given user-agent by the browser (str)
 			what if the user-agent doesn't match? : Force re-login (resulting in a new session/key)
 -ip: ip address of user. if ip changes, change this value (str)
 			Ip is allowed to change since clients may change from wifi to mobile network, or between wifi networks
