Current Development
===================

Storybouncer is constantly being developed!
(Well not constantly 24/7, I need to sleep at some point)

#### Done!

#### Going to happen

	    and I'll most likely add it)
*		A fancy-er logo
*		Ability to view the authors of a book
*		Ability to vote to end a book (they can't go on forever)
