How storybouncer works:
=======================

Someone starts a book with a title and a paragraph. Everyone reads this, and following the same idea of the story someone writes another paragraph, a suggested paragraph. And another person. And another. Then, all the suggested paragraphs are voted on by the community, and the one with the most votes is selected to be part of the story. The process then repeats, and a story is born.
